## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code has been developed using the Anaconda distribution of Python. The version of Python used is v3.9.7.
The main libraries used in developing the code are pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Business Objectives<a name="objectives"></a>

In this notebook I’ve analyzed the AirBnB rental properties located in the city of Boston, MA. Some specific questions targeted in the investigation are:
* How does the availability vary across months? Are there certain months when availability is high or low?
* Is there a difference in availability between weekdays vs weekends?
* How does the price vary across different months?
* What property types are expensive to rent?
* What are the least expensive and most expensive neighborhoods in the Boston area? 
Towards the end, I build a model to predict the price of a rental property. There are two regression algorithms used to build the model, Lasso Regression and RandomForest Regression.
